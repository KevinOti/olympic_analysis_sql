# olympic_analysis_sql

There are many tools that can be used for analysis but quick to go tool of preference is still sql the postgre flavor, sql allows one to write in plain english and the results are basically what we put in the scripting panel.

Interest was to learn the data and answer some question that came to mind once i piqued the data.

Top questions

  - How Many unique athletes have ever graced the competition since inception to 2016
  - Comparison between the 2 genders (Male and Female)
  - Cityies to have hosted the competition
  - The most popular competition
  - Countries to have participated since inception


#### Quick glimpes of what the analysis tries to bring out.
